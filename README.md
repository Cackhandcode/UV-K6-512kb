# UV-K6-512kb
# please help
#hi all I'm new to github forgive me I have no clue what I'm doing but this seems to be the place for radio firmware.

#I'm currently a baofeng user (forgive me) but the modding that's been done on quanshengs has made me want one and try it out.

#if anyone knows of mods for baofengs too would open up a new avenue for this hardware for me.

#from my research quanshengs mods are limited due to having a small memory.

I've seen some UV-K6 on aliexpress with 512kb memory advertised which I believe is substantially more memory.

#few questions;
#has anyone tried modding it?
#can it take more mods?
#I've seen a flasher somewhere for none coders like me but it seems to make to pick due to memory limits is there a flasher that allows more mods?
or a simple way for someone like me?

many thanks for reading

not sure if this is the right way to tag some people who might be able to help.
